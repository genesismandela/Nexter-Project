# GENESIS MANDELA - Nexter-Project

// HEY! I am Genesis Mandela and I am a self taught developer and designer, currently located in Dublin, wanting to improve my tech skills to the next level.

// This is the project Nexter, website created with the CSS preprocessor SASS using the latest Grid and Flex features, and where I also apply some Javascript functionallity.

==== PROJECT DESCRIPTION 🖥️ ====

This project has been created following an Udemy CSS and SASS course where the Grid property is covered from start to end.

Udemy Course created by Jonas Schmedtmann.

--> My personal review;

In this project for the first time I had the oportunity to start using the command line to install node and use npm features. As well as node-sass package and configuration to make SASS work properly.

Got the theory of Grid-template-row and column to make a layout composition. Understand that mixin position, flex and grid can be pretty useful in projects.

I am much more confortable with Flex that with Grid. 

💥💥💥💥💥 I REALLY NEED TO START TO USE MORE GRID TO STYLE LAYOUTS and HAVE MORE CSS SKILLS FOR MORE SITUATIONS. 💥💥💥💥💥

--> JS considerations;

I do not really have difficulties when styling new elements with CSS, I am confortable with the positioning and flex, and not using Grid so much. I think for specific things is much better.

About JavaScript, being a project to learn and reforce the fundamentals I being quite overwhelming behind the scenes. I mean there are times where I get confused with the syntax and how I should organize a JS file.

In general all the features used in this file I know how they work but I am sure that I am missing many things that will have a better solution.

Not sure about semicolons, where and when to declare variables when working with functions. NEED TO READ MORE ABOUT HOW JAVASCRIPT WORKS.

To be one of the first webpages where I use JS I am quite happy about the results, I am sure that many things are not perfect but I made things work as I want.
